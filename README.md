CAR PRICE PREDICTION USING ML

THE AIM OF THE PROJECT IS TO PREDICT THE PRICE OF SECOND HAND CARS USING MACHINE LEARNING.<br/>
The prediction has been done using linear regression and random forest regression algorithms.<br/>
The dataset car.csv is a publicly available kaggle dataset.<br/>
      - The dataset contains the following attributes : Name,year,selling price ,present price,kms driven ,fuel type ,seller type,transimission,owner.<br/>
Data pre-processing-Label Encoding and one hot encoding has been performed on fuel type,seller type ,transmission.<br/>
Results - Random Forest Regressor shows better accuracy in predicting the car prices.
